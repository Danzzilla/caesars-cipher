# Caesars Cipher

The purpose of me writing this program was to get familiar with a different IDE I began 
using and to get the hang of uploading my projects and code to GitHub.

## **Things I learned**
* Was introduced to
  * Eclipse IDE
  * Github
  * CircleCI
* Testing code
* Creating different project branches
* Built more knowledge on top of what I already know
