# Caesars Cipher

I worked alongside [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PgZCJNzY9M&t=1809s) to get familiar 
with Eclipse IDE and its features, and on uploading my projects to GitHub repositories.

The purpose of me writing this program was to get familiar with a different IDE I began 
using and to get the hang of uploading my projects and code to GitHub.

## **Things I learned**
* Was introduced to
  * Eclipse IDE
  * Github
  * CircleCI
  * Gradle Projects
* Testing code
* Creating different project branches
* Built more knowledge on top of what I already know
